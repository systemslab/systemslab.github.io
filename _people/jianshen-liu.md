        - Smart Storage Devices in Genomics 
---

Jianshen Liu is a 2nd year Ph.D. student working in the System Research Lab advised by Professor Carlos Maltzahn. The goal of his current project Smart Storage Devices in Genomics is to investigate solutions in the context of genomics for the trade-off between in-storage computing (moving function to data to minimize data movement and security exposure) and external computing (moving data to function requiring high-performance CPU and GPU farms). Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, he worked for four years as an SDE focused on developing Android apps and maintaining back-end services of high performance recommendation system.
